################SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION ON THE SCRIPTS AND DATA#################

########################1. DATA STRUCTURE######################################
CREATE THE FOLLOWING DATA STRUCTURE IN ORDER TO BE COMPATABLE WITH THE SCRIPTS
THIS IS RECOMMENDED BUT NOT NECESSARY.

1.Create folders 'analysis'and 's3_data'

2. In the 'analysis', create the following subfolders:
'year' (e.g '2017') > 'coastal_cleaning' > 'fu_processing'

3. In the 'coastal_cleaning' create the following subfolder:
'months' substituted by '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', '12'
and also 'ag', 'figures_ag' ,'ag_interpolated' and 'ag_plume'

4. in 'fu_processing' create the following subfolders:
's3_fu_daily' and 's3_fu_daily_clipped'

5. In both 's3_fu_daily' and 's3_fu_daily_clipped' create the following subfolders:

'months' subsituted by '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', '12'
  
The following steps were conducted in ArcMap 10.5 software.

#####################2. AREA OF INTEREST MASK##################################
AN AREA OF INTEREST HAD TO BE CREATED FOR THE LIVERPOOL BAY. THIS TIFF SERVES FOR
SNAPPING THE RASTERS IN THE CLIPPING FUNCTION TO THE BOTTOM LEFT CORNER SO ALL
RASTERS ALIGN. 

Steps how it was created:
1. Create an area of interst shapefile (AOI).
2. Using 'Polygon to Raster' tool and export the AOI using 0.003
resolution as area_of_interest_name.tif.

########################3. SEA MASK############################################
1. Create a fishnet.shp using 0.003 resolution. In the environments, set-up extent, and other settings 
such as resolution, snapping, processing extent etc accorindg to area_of_interest_name.tif.

2. Create a new field 'sea_mask' ('short' type or in other words a short integer) in the fishnet.shp.

3. Use 'Select by spatial location' to intersect the coastline shapefile
wiht the full resolution (f) from here: https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/shorelines/gshhs.html 
with the fishnet. This source of the coastline is one of the highest resolution coastlines publicly available.
However, please use the appropriate coastline for your area of interest.

3. Create a new field in the sea_mask fishnet called 'class' ('short' type or in other words a short integer) . Use the 'Field calculator' and populate the 'class' field by 0 = land. This will assign 0 to the fishnet grid squares which intersect with the coast.

4. Reverse the selection order and use the field calculator to populate the 'class' column in the 'sea_mask'
by 1=water.

5. Use 'Polygon to raster' to convert the fishnet into a tif file called sea_mask.tif based on the 'class' field values.

#######################4.INTERTIDAL MASK######################################

1. Merge and dissolve coastal and transitional Water Framework Directive 
waterbodies shapefile
England: https://data.gov.uk/dataset/3a75ec5f-a361-475c-80e3-52d93bbc5dbe/wfd-transitional-and-coastal-waterbodies-cycle-2
Wales: http://lle.gov.wales/catalogue/item/WaterFrameworkDirectiveCoastalWaterbodiesCycle2?lang=en

2. Create a new field called 'int_mask' (type short) in the 'sea_mask' fishnet.

3. Use 'Select by spatial location' to intersect merged WFD waterbodies with the fishnet
and use field calculator to populate the 'inter_mask' with 1. This will flag the grids that intersect the fishnet as 1.

4. Reverse selection and use the field calculator to populate the 'inter_mask'
with 0.

5. Use 'Polygon to raster' tool to exort the intertidal_mask.tif using the 'inter_mask' field.

6. Expand the intertidal mask since it might not capture all the transitional
waters due to discrepancies in resolution between Sentinel 3 data and WFD waterbodies.
Run 'Expand' tool on the 'intertidal_mask.tif' with the number of cells = 2.

This mask will be used to clean the coastal areas during the data processing.
If you apply the scripts to an area of interest outside of the UK, you might want
to think about what interidal processing mask might be suitable for your area.
